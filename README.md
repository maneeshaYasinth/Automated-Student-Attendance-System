# Automated Student Attendance System for OOP Course Module

## Introduction
The Automated Student Attendance System is developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course module. This system aims to automate the process of tracking student attendance, providing instructors with a streamlined solution for attendance management.

## Project Overview
The system allows instructors to register students and lecturers, mark attendance for each lecture, generate attendance reports, and manage user accounts. It includes user-friendly interfaces for both instructors and students, enhancing communication and efficiency in attendance tracking tasks.

## Installation
To run the Automated Student Attendance System locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main application file.

## Usage
Once the system is installed, users can perform the following tasks:
- Log in with their credentials.
- Add students and lecturers to the system.
- Mark attendance for each lecture.
- Generate attendance reports based on specified criteria.
- Manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting accounts.

## File Structure
The project's file structure is organized as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code files.
- `data/`: Stores data files used by the system.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including this README.md.
